# Tactile-Analysis
Project on texture recognition, numericization, and replication through applied math and material engineering. Also dabbles a little bit in electrodynamics and general physics. Exploring the use of mathematica, MATLAB, and python for this project, and will probably use C++ for the hardware later on.
